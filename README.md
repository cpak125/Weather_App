# Weather App

Developed a simple weather app. This web app allows users to view the weather conditions of a city. Users can search for a city's weather by entering the city's name and the country or by zip code, if it's a city located in the US. All weather information such as location, temperature, humidity, and conditions is being pulled from OpenWeatherMap's API.
